edt_surrogate Version 0.9b

The surrogates are generated using the algorithm described in

  An Accurate Measure of the Instantaneous Discharge Probability, with
  Application to Unitary Joint-Event Analysis
  Quentin Pauluis, Stuart N. Baker
  Neural Computation 2000 12:3, 647-666

Pauluis does not describe a method for determining the shape parameter
for the gamma distribution used in generating the surrogates.  For
that we use the method described in

  Estimating Spiking Irregularities Under Changing Environments
  Keiji Miura, Masato Okada, Shun-ichi Amari
  Neural Computation 2006 18:10, 2359-2386 

In Pauluis' algorithm, the firing rate is smoothed by convolution with
a gaussian.  He does not describe the padding method used in the
convolution.  In order to preserve the expected number of spikes in
the interval (i.e., the integral of the firing rate) we use mirror
padding.  Zero padding would reduce the expected number of spikes.
